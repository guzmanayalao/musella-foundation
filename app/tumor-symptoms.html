                                <p>Brain tumor symptoms vary from patient to patient, and most of these symptoms can also be found in people who do NOT have brain tumors. Therefore, the only sure way to tell if you have a brain tumor or not is to see your
                                    doctor and get a brain scan.</p>

                                <p>Brain tumors are rare, so most doctors do not think of brain tumors right away. If you are concerned, ask them if it is possible that you have a brain tumor. A common theme we hear is that the doctor never considered a
                                    diagnosis of brain tumor.</p>

                                <p>We did a survey of about 1,400 brain tumor patients to learn what symptoms they had that caused them to seek medical care. You can see the full results at the bottom of this page. The survey is now complete.</p>

                                <p>There is a more detailed paper on brain tumor symptoms at: <a href="#" class="is-bright-blue">symptoms.pdf</a></p>

                                    <h3>Headaches</h3>
                                    <p>This was the most common symptom, with 46% of the patients reporting having headaches. They described the headaches in many different ways, with no one pattern being a sure sign of brain tumor. Many - perhaps most -
                                        people get headaches at some point in their life, so this is not a definite sign of brain tumors. You should mention it to your doctors if the headaches are: different from those you ever had before, are accompanied
                                        by nausea / vomiting, are made worse by bending over or straining when going to the bathroom.(1) Seizures: This was the second most common symptom reported, with 33% of the patients reporting a seizure before the
                                        diagnosis was made. Seizures can also be caused by other things, like epilepsy, high fevers, stroke, trauma, and other disorders. (3) This is a symptom that should never be ignored, whatever the cause. In a person
                                        who never had a seizure before, it usually indicates something serious and you must get a brain scan. </p>

                                    <h3>Seizures</h3>
                                    <p>A seizure is a sudden, involuntary change in behavior, muscle control, consciousness, and/or sensation. Symptoms of a seizure can range from sudden, violent shaking and total loss of consciousness to muscle twitching
                                        or slight shaking of a limb. Staring into space, altered vision, and difficulty in speaking are some of the other behaviors that a person may exhibit while having a seizure. Approximately 10% of the U.S. population
                                        will experience a single seizure in their lifetime. <br> Nausea and / or vomiting is more likely to point towards a brain tumor if it is accompanied by the other symptoms mentioned here.</p>

                                    <h3>Nausea and Vomiting</h3>
                                    <p> As with headaches, these are non-specific - which means that most people who have nausea and vomiting do NOT have a brain tumor. Twenty-two percent of the people in our survey reported that they had nausea and /or vomiting
                                        as a symptom. </p>

                                    <h3>Vision or hearing problems </h3>
                                    <p>Twenty-five percent reported vision problems. This one is easy - if you notice any problem with your hearing or vision, it must be checked out. I commonly hear that the eye doctor is the first one to make the diagnosis
                                        - because when they look in your eyes, they can sometimes see signs of increased intracranial pressure. This must be investigated. Problems with weakness of the arms, legs or face muscles, and strange sensations
                                        in your head or hands. Twenty-five percent reported weakness of the arms and/or legs. Sixteen percent reported strange feelings in the head, and 9% reported strange feelings in the hands. This may result in an altered
                                        gait, dropping objects, falling, or an asymmetric facial expression. These could also be symptoms of a stroke. Sudden onset of these symptoms is an emergency - you should go to the emergency room. If you notice
                                        a gradual change over time, you must report it to your doctor.</p>

                                    <p>Many reported behavioral and cognitive changes, such as: problems with recent memory, inability to concentrate or finding the right words, acting out - no patience or tolerance, and loss of inhibitions - saying or doing
                                        things that are not appropriate for the situation. </p>

                                    <h3>IF you think something is wrong, go see your doctor.</h3>
                                    <p> Explain that you are worried it is a brain tumor. Keep in mind that brain tumors are relatively rare compared to most other disorders, so the primary care doctor is not usually going to be thinking it is a brain tumor.
                                        They first think of more common causes of the symptoms. Sixty-four percent of the time, the doctor thought it was NOT a brain tumor when respondents first went to the doctor. More than half of the people reported
                                        that they had the symptoms for more than a month before the correct diagnosis of brain tumor was made. With the malignant brain tumors, a delay of a month in starting treatment can make a major impact on the outcome.</p>

                                <li><span>I had an abnormal(bacharcardia-not sure of the spelling, sorry) slow heart rate, which was found first in cardiac testing. After the tumor was found the heart rate was related to the tumor.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Hear attack</span></li>
                                <li><span>In reality it turned out I was having seizures but I kept telling my husband and friends about these horrible nightmares I had had while sleeping. My teeth would be clenched and I could not move to get my husband awake in the bed next to me to help me. The sound of my teeth crunching together was terrible and then nothing...I awoke but remembered because I was so sore the next day what had happened. I would and still do have a headache.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Fatigue, temper</span></li>

                                <li><span>I had low grade H/As for several years prior to having a seizure which I never gave much thought to. Perhaps it was tumor related - I don’t know and my docs never pursued.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Coordination problems - could have possibly been from the double vision.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Tingling, burning sensations in my face. Growing instability on my feet for no apparent reason.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Unusual behavior. Loss of short term memory. Fatigue. The symptoms were split in time: headaches 2-4 months, maybe longer before diagnosis; vomiting 3 days before diagnosis; strange behavior 2-3 weeks before diagnosis. Fatigue 5-6 months prior.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I had no real symptoms. No more headaches than the average person.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Disorientation,loss of sense of time</span></li>
                                <li><span>Tremors</span></li>
                                <li><span>I seemed that my brain just stopped functioning and I have never determined how long this lasted.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Behavior changed. Became unaccountably judgmental and uncharacteristically cruel five years before diagnosis. There were flu-like symptoms for a few months before diagnosis, and along with this, he was weak and foggy-minded. A year before, he looked pale and weak.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Not being able to concentrate</span></li>
                                <li><span>Handwriting was shaky swallowing problems balance problems</span></li>
                                <li><span>A slight hand tremor and a drooping eyelid were the symptoms that lead to diagnosis. Headaches, although recognized as having occurred, were not frequent enough to warrant concern.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Imbalance of the environment,losing balance. There were some cognitive changes despite a high IQ such as a dyslexic problem. I was told it was stress, anxiety. Certain noise pitches made me feel that felt I could lose my balance from. Problems with crowds after being on stage for years and in crowds of hundreds of people. Movement of the environment such as a escalator was a problem to navigate the footing.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Frequent bloody noses for about 2 years before dx. Stopped after resection. Dr. denies this as symptom.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Dizziness</span></li>
                                <li><span>My nausea/vomiting and strongest headaches were in the am and by early afternoon they would go away. It looked like “morning sickness”. the symptoms increased in frequency and intensity over about 1 1/2 years before i went to a new doc and he sent me to a neurologist and an MRI was ordered. This was in 1991.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I was first diagnosed with having anxiety / panic attacks. The left side of my body would go numb and tingle. After my first MRI, they discovered I was experiencing seizers NOT anxiety attacks.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Looking back on this, my husband had twitching feet at night when he slept and snored horribly. After his surgery he had neither one.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Precious puberty, and other hormonal issues</span></li>
                                <li><span>Yes, the symptoms that caused me to ask for a CAT scan were swelling &amp; numbness on one side of my face. This happened one weekend &amp; I asked the dr. on call to schedule me a CAT scan. My family dr. did not suspect a tumor until the radiologist saw it (plum size) on my CAT scan &amp; immediately sent me &amp; the film to his office. He sent me to a neurologist who put me in the hospital on an IV for steroids and scheduled me for surgery, which I had after a 2nd opinion the next week. -------------------------------------The “strange” feeling in my head was more of a spacey, disconnected feeling lasting only a few moments which came and went over several weeks. The vision problem was like occasional spots or floaters that come &amp; go. My family dr. thought it was maybe a blood pressure problem, but my pressure was normal.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Off balance, frequently dropping things and falling.</span></li>
                                <li><span>It wasn’t dx until the day I had surgery. The tumor had exploded and caused headache, paralysis, coma.</span></li>
                                <li><span>The week to two weeks prior to diagnosis, a very disconnected feeling almost like being in dream, things felt far away. Dizziness , just not feeling well.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Pre-seizure, I had trouble finding simple words. It was so bad I went to see a counselor, and we thought it was due to anxiety. However, my life is fairly normal, not a lot of anxiety.</span></li>
                                <li><span>NOT SYMPTOMATIC AT THIS TIME, FOUND DURING ROUTINE MRI FOR MONITORING OF NEUROFIBROMATOSIS</span></li>

                                <li><span>I had problems with organization, concentration, reading, finding words, short-term memory, although none of these led to the diagnosis. Even after seizures started, it took a few months before the tumor was diagnosed, because my seizure symptoms were not understood to be such.</span></li>
                                <li><span>My doctor thought my speech sounded slurred, and that my gait was “off.”</span></li>
                                <li><span>Yes, my husband (I was his caregiver) started complaining of his pinky finger and ring finger in his left hand having a tingling. Then it went to a pulsating into his upper arm then 7 months later had a seizure</span></li>

For a long time I have had issues watching the TV if there is movement or light. I would feel as though something was rolling around in my head. It was like an electrical impulse that would make me feel strange and horrible. It is difficult to explain. Lately they are much more frequent and instead of one here and there I may have 4 or 5 one after the other and I have to close my eyes until they pass. It leaves me feeling as though it is a run up to something bigger and bad and scares the bejeebers out of me. The strange feeling in my head left me knowing “something” was not right, I just figured it was some type of electrical misfire and I lived with this for couple of years. Unsure why, but have vascular issues in legs mottling purple rash under skin, broken blood vessels not there before... My meningioma is located on the saggital sinus within the falx and is small. 1.6x 1.1. It was an incidental finding looking for possible MS...13 doctors later I did get diagnosed with Chronic Lyme disease. The M did grow approx 4mm in 4 months last MRI. It was 1.2X1.1 I am told there should be no symptoms other than headaches.. If you have any info on this type of tumor in this area pls can you fwd to me? I was diagnosed with mild encephalitis 3 times in the last 3 years without spinal tap. Almost a yearly occurrence I was listed as possible west nile virus... The episodes would go in approx 6 wks or so symptoms were headaches, neck pain, dizziness and were awful. ....thank you My e-mail is quicksale4u@aol.com Thanks, Carolyn</span></li>

I traveled to UVA to see a Dr. that treated my son for cavernoma of brain stem,that ruptured and caused tremendous swelling in his brain causing stroke like symptoms. Resection was preformed with success. Thank GOD... The Dr, said that I have two of the same kind of tumors but located in different parts of the brain. No action is to be taken unless symptoms start.

She sees that it is not the same style too, but still can’t change the style. She laughs hysterically at things that are definitely not funny and can’t stop laughing. Restless legs throughout the night. Can’t sleep. Moves excessively slow, says she must think about how to move her legs and hands for a long time before she can move, must think about the steps. Screams to care-givers that she can do it herself, and then feels very guilty that she has treated them this way. Greets acquaintances with “Hello, how are you? Glad you could come.” But can’t talk to closest of relatives, turns away. We are hurt, but feel it is a symptom of the tumor. She can sing perfectly with her Sweet Adeline friends who come to visit, even complicated harmony and rhythm, but can’t talk to us. Paralysis on right side. Though we know she realizes she has a tumor and feels very badly that she is soon to die, she has never cried or teared up, though prior to brain tumor she was normally emotional and teared up when her feelings were hurt. Said things that didn’t make sense. Had difficulty talking and making us understand what she needed.</span></li>

I had severe pain in the bone above my right eye. Light made the pain worse and I often vomited which is why I thought they were migraines.

                                <li><span>Blinding unbearable headaches, for some time mostly behind one eye and DX as cluster headaches, migraines,etc. Also headaches began in the back, right side of head. Constant pounding pain. Those continue to this day, 14 years later. The tumor was right frontal lobe. There has never been an explanation for the pain in the back of head.</span></li>
                                <li><span>On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was a 10+, lasting four days sometimes.</span></li>

                                <li><span>My husband described these as terrible, aching headaches on the right side of his head (his tumor was in the right temporal lobe) and on top-front of his head. His usual remedy of Excedrin did not even touch them. He was prone to earaches on that side of his head and thought maybe he had a bad ear infection. He told the doctor about the headaches, but NOT about the other symptoms (dreamlike state, smells, etc.) He only complained about the headaches, so they gave him something for the “earaches”. He did not recognize the focal seizures for what they were. When he finally told the doctor (and me!) about the other symptoms, the doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound of the carotid arteries (thinking maybe he was having TIAs) and an MRI.</span></li>
                                <li><span>She had moderate headaches for a couple of months before her seizure, more late in the day. Tylenol would take care of it.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Pounding/Blinding headaches where only being in a dark place with meds helped.</span></li>
                                <li><span>No different than headaches I had my entire life. Mostly when I was tired or overworked, in the back of my head.</span></li>

                                <li><span>I had severe headaches daily. It was progressively bad -- usually by noon the headache was so bad I’d have taken several extra strength tylenol. In the afternoon, I’d have to take a 2-3 hour nap. This went on for a couple years before my grand mal seizure; after which i was diagnosed with an oliodendroglioma.</span></li>
                                <li><span>The patient described the headache as the worst in her life. She was accustomed to recurrent and severe sinus headaches, but the pre-diagnosis headache was totally debilitating.</span></li>
                                <li><span>My son said his headaches were excruciating. The pain was like no other headache he had ever had before and he had been experiencing migraines for several years.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Migraine</span></li>
                                <li><span>Very intense headache, but quite short in duration. Like a migrane (sp) but much shorter. The Dr. first thought that these were migranes. Also during the headaches my blood pressure was very high and in general my bp was elevated. I was told later that these were likely seizures.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Sharp.. not long lasting</span></li>
                                <li><span>My daughter described the headaches as throbbing. They would happen in the middle of the night and felt different than any other headache in her life.</span></li>
                                <li><span>* I had a grand mal seizure, was brought to the hospital unconscious, run thru CT and MRI and BT was discovered..No conversation took place</span></li>
                                <li><span>I had pounding migraine-type headaches for 20 years before my diagnosis, but did not associate them with the tumor until they went away after the surgery.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Headaches would awaken me during the night. Had some headaches which occurred suddenly , sharp intense pain in the top of head associated with nausea. Headaches had nothing to do with being diagnosed. When I realized I could no longer work in the medical profession because of memory problems, I went to Rehab services. They referred me to a psychiatrist. He ordered the MRI which found the tumor.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Don’t know as my daughter was only 1 year old at time of diagnosis.</span></li>
                                <li><span>A headache so bad like I have never experienced before.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Several types. Screw type pain in temples and down behind the ear structure. Sharp stabbing lightening bolts in the side. Skull cap squeezing pain. Pain at back where head joins back bone.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Whole head throbbing pain, not localized</span></li>
                                <li><span>General ache, throbbing</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like a pole going through my right eye diagonally exiting at the bas of my skull. Also a fullness in my right ear that felt like a wet finger was in my ear.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like you wanted to pull your head off!!!!</span></li>
                                <li><span>Hurt in one spot (right temporal lobe) and were worse in the morning. Felt like head was going to explode</span></li>
                                <li><span>Horrible headaches and lights made them worse...throwing up due to headache...</span></li>
                                <li><span>Intense pressure headaches; initially diagnosed as a sinus infection. I said many times, somewhat jokingly, that it felt like “my skull was getting crushed.” In fact, it was.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Pain right behind the eyes that would not go away even with over the counter pain relief</span></li>
                                <li><span>Severe with band like sensation with pain into shoulders and neck.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I can’t remember the headaches before the first tumor (1986), but headaches now can be very severe: a feeling of swelling from the inside out; a feeling like “just explode and get it over with”.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Some headaches, no special characteristics</span></li>
                                <li><span>Didn’t have except when dehydrated</span></li>
                                <li><span>Progressively the headaches worsened to the point where I stayed in bed. Pain along backside of head, like a tightening vice. Had accompanying nausea/vomiting.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Just an ordinary run of the mill headache in the back of the head, usually when tired. Not all of the time, maybe a few times a week for a few hours each time. Not unlike headaches I had my entire life.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Yes, headaches right before the diagnosis! They were rated a 6 on a scale of 10. Never had headaches before- but, definitely were felt!</span></li>
                                <li><span>Intense indescribable pain</span></li>
                                <li><span>Again, I don’t know if these qualify as they have stopped since sx for hydrocephalus, but I would have “visual” migraines that would last on average 45 minutes and rather than get a full blown migraine headache, I would feel somewhat dazed and exhausted once the auras stopped.</span></li>
                                <li><span>No abnormal headaches.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I had migraine headaches most of my life, but then I started getting really severe headaches that the migraine medicine didn’t help with. Severe, intense pain in the back of the head lasting for several days. Nausea &amp; vomiting almost constant with them. I had never gone to the hospital before, but the first time Mine were this severe, I knew I should go, but I was in a strange town. This happened monthly, then they got closer &amp; closer and lasted longer. I was taking Vicodin constantly trying to control the pain. When they got really bad during an ear infection, the doctor gave me a shot of Demerol and sent me for a CAT scan, which prompted an MRI which lead to surgery &amp; chemo. My first doctor left the practice after I had seen her for several years with memory problems &amp; the headaches. I saw another doctor in the same office when I got the ear infection and she sent me for tests right away.</span></li>
                                <li><span>FEROCIOUS HEADACHES (AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER) SEEMED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A ? HEIGHTENED SENSE OF/AWARENESS OF LIGHT/SOUND, EVEN THE SOUND OF SOMEONE’S FOOTSTEPS WD AGGRAVATE THE PAIN</span></li>
                                <li><span>VERY SEVERE - SCREAMING AND WRITHING IN PAIN</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like severe pressure in the back of the head. Only lasting 5 minutes maximum but extremely severe.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Slight headaches sort of in sinus area</span></li>
                                <li><span>On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was rated 11. The worst pain I ever experienced in my life. Much worse than child birth.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Pain at the base of skull on left side, moved up the head to behind the left eye, felt like sinus headache. Responded to sinus medication until just before diagnosis when nothing helped.</span></li>
                                <li><span>The worst and ultimate headache just before diagnosis was a pain behind my eye which felt as if there was so much pressure my eye would fly out of the socket. Recurrent headaches were all in the sinus area. In the past I had headaches/pain from the back of my neck at the base of my head up towards the front of my forehead.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Squeezing pain at the back of my head worse than the worst migraine you could imagine. Went into SEVERE nausea by the 5th day.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like a vice grip in the back of my head and neck You may not want this input as I had the B.T. removed 11 years ago</span></li>
                                <li><span>Violent migraines, auras --diagnosed as “premenopausal migraine,” no treatment needed (5 years) one evening of vomiting, fainting, “maybe we should take a cat scan” then diagnosis (meningioma, right parietal lobe 7 centimeters) all above 6 years prior to diagnosis --including 3-4 visits to pc doctor, neurologist, gynecologist, othomologist</span></li>
                                <li><span>Headache felt like sinus headaches probably why they initially treated as such.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Extreme headaches to the point of not being able to function properly.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like a hot iron going up through my nostril and into the right side of my head.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Migraines</span></li>
                                <li><span>Tight band being tightened around forehead, ice poker being driven into head</span></li>
                                <li><span>Pressure behind eyes</span></li>
                                <li><span>He complained only of a dull headache. That, however, does not mean that he didn’t have chronic headaches, nor does it mean that they couldn’t have been excruciating. As I’ve said, he did not want us to know that there was anything wrong, so he never complained.</span></li>
                                <li><span>A constant pain in one specific place (where the tumor was located). A sharp pain. It did NOT throb, but was consistent. When I shook my head, it felt like something was there. When I bent over, my head felt like it would explode.</span></li>

                                <li><span>I had headaches only slight ones on awakening most commonly if i took a nap. They would be often go away by them selves. Often just a little queasy with these headaches. Monster headaches with menses!!!!!</span></li>
                                <li><span>The neurosurgeon advised me that the headaches were not related to the brain tumor. I had what is considered an incidental diagnosis, a few months after a car accident. My primary care doctor sent me for an MRI. Diagnosis was by MRI.</span></li>
                                <li><span>From the hemorrhage, the worst headache in the world.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Shooting pains lancing across my brain that lasted only seconds - but brought on by any exertion (laughing etc)</span></li>
                                <li><span>Terrible. The Dr. was treating as a sinus headache. Took all kinds of pain pills with no relief. Vomiting, severe pain</span></li>
                                <li><span>Pressure, could not stand myself, would put cold towels around my head, and hit my head,(tyl #3 and demerol did not work for pain), pain might go away for a few days, but I would still feels unbalance, loss vision, out of breath, then I would vomit for no reasons then pain would be unbearable.

                                <li><span>Headaches did not occur until about five years into the diagnosis and were a significant factor in the decision to finally have surgery. Headaches occurred primarily in the morning upon waking, almost every morning. They dissipated as the day progressed and were helped by aspirin. Headaches disappeared immediately after surgery and did not return.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Only one the day before dx. Hurt very badly all day and night with almost no relief until went in next morning for CT and the found PNET Medulloblastoma.</span></li>
                                <li><span>An unbelievable, indescribable pounding with vomiting.</span></li>

Went to ER and MRI found tumor. I had been to my primary care Physician for migraines. About 7 months earlier. Tumor is in right frontal lobe.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Caffeine withdrawal type headache.</span></li>
                                <li><span>A band across the forehead above the brow where sinus headaches normally are felt.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Headaches were extremely severe. He was awake all night in pain the night before he was diagnosed. The pain was better in the morning. The headaches were there for 2 days.</span></li>
                                <li><span>The pain brought me to my knees. Also vision went black</span></li>
                                <li><span>Severe, sharp pain at top of head. Persistent, beyond normal headache.</span></li>
                                <li><span>They were there when I woke up in the morning. Then got better after I was up and took a shower.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Instant, usually associated with activity</span></li>
                                <li><span>Headaches started when I was 12, thought to be menstrual or stress related,with adolescent mood swings. Right sided only, deep into the temporal region and the right eye socket to the back of the skull. Very painful, knife-like not dull like a hypertensive headache. Daily headaches always after school. EEG in 1974 was done because of them. Vomiting didn’t begin until 1988 when the undiagnosed lesion was finally found. Headaches continue still today, 34 years later from commencement.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Had first headache four days before diagnosis, intermittent vomiting for 6 weeks. Headache was a sharp pain behind the eye.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I would wake up with my neck and head hurting so much i thought my neck would break if i turned it wrong. My first tumor was located in the 4th ventricle and blocked the flow of CSF which is what intensified my pain.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Severe pain over left eye when bending over.</span></li>
                                <li><span>The headaches were like sinus headaches and this was my diagnosis for a year or more. Treated with sinus medications.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Severe painful headaches that would last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Very intense, they were worse at the time when i was vomiting. With the headaches I became sensitive to light, nausea..and they would start in one area of my brain and continue to another area.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Headaches were similar to previous sinus headaches , pressure was focused on the right side of the face, including the frontal sinus area, and behind the right eye. In my observation the difference was no relief was achieved from the regular “Motrin sinus “ med. which would normally give re-fief, within a day if enough was taken. This headache never gave up!!!! One of the determining factors for the ER MD to take a CAT scan, headache had been building for a week.</span></li>
                                <li><span>200 TIMES MORE PAINFUL THAT YOUR WORST HEADACHE. UNBEARABLE. LIKE A VISE GRIP SQUEEZING MY HEAD.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I started having headaches when I was about 12 years old. My headaches were very excruciating, and would basically hinder me from executing my daily activities. I would end up laying down all day, and not moving all that much. It hurt when I moved around my head or body, so I remained still as much as I could.</span></li>
                                <li><span>It felt like my head was going to explode. I’d get a “hot” sensation around my neck and at the top of my head and then the pain would be so bad I would pass out.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Mild headaches has been going for a long time, especially in the afternoon.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Only had one significant headache about a month before diagnosis -- didn’t think anything of it== ALSO: re the questions below about the doctor’s diagnosis below: a variety of doctors missed this (an M.D. psychiatrist, who should have had some neurology in his background, totally dismissed, on at least 3 occasions, the complaints of “word-jumbling” (now known as aphasia) and the funny electric feelings up and down my husband’s left arm (now known as focal seizures); an ER doc didn’t do tests on his head after my husband fell down the steps; the orthopedist who saw my husband for a 6-week post injury check was the one that said he really needed to see a neurologist; my husband finally agreed to see a neurologist, and the only person I could beg his way into that day actually was a neurosurgeon friend-of-a-friend, who knew it was something significant, but thought it was probably a slow bleed from the fall down the steps, but he knew that needed to get an MRI immediately.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Terrible pain just hours before emergency room visit. None before then. (See next question)</span></li>
                                <li><span>Horrible pain in the middle of my forehead. Debilitating, like someone was driving a nail through my forehead.</span></li>
                                <li><span>They hurt for about a month prior to the diagnosis, mostly in the back of the head. Initial guess by the doc was that it was a sinus infection. Near the end pain pills lost their effectiveness forcing my wife to go into the hospital where they did a brain scan.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Nagging headache the day before the seizure, but not debilitating.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Pain radiating up the back and right side of my neck; then later a squeezing all over</span></li>
                                <li><span>Like those when we don’t have enough coffee in the morning</span></li>
                                <li><span>Headaches mostly on right side of head stabbing light pains</span></li>
                                <li><span>Mild, quick, pinching nerve type headaches. Didn’t need to take tylenol for them. Would happen every few minutes. Didn’t disturb my sleep.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Extraordinarily Painful</span></li>
                                <li><span>My husband had only 3 headaches which led to diagnosis. The headaches were like migraines, with tunnel vision and nausea. The tunnel vision and nausea only accompanied the headaches. They were the worst headaches he’d ever had, and the pain was concentrated in the back, near the base of his skull. (His tumor is in the front, though.) A few things didn’t add up to “migraine” though - migraines are usually behind the eyes, he had no light sensitivity like one does with a migraine, and we wracked our brains but could find no trigger for the headaches. Those oddities, combined with the fact that it’s unusual for a 33 year old man to suddenly have migraines after never having any headaches, made us seek a neurologist quickly. Although the neurologist truly thought he was fine, and just having migraines, he did order an MRI “to rule out a tumor or stroke.”  The MRI was done immediately and led to the tumor dx. Although the neurologist suggested the MRI, we wouldn’t have left the office that day without one. I had a very bad gut feeling that something was very wrong.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Severe across the brow and the back of neck</span></li>
                                <li><span>Very strong migraine type</span></li>
                                <li><span>Slight headache on playing high notes on my trumpet</span></li>
                                <li><span>I had these severe migraines that kept waking me up at night when laying on pillow. I could only sleep in reclining chair.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Some were mild, one was really severe, (right before the diagnosis.) My sister has migraines, so I thought maybe that was what they were.</span></li>

                                <li><span>I had headaches for far over a year before diagnosis which were usually similar to sinus headaches, although sometimes I had migraines.</span></li>
                                <li><span>If felt as if I were to take a power drill to the left side of my skull, and make a hole, I could relieve some pressure. I knew there was pressure in my head, but I thought that my sinuses were just overly filled (or so I was hoping)</span></li>

                                <li><span>The whole back part of my head would hurt and continue to hurt for 4-5 days in a row. Nothing worked to make it stop</span></li>
                                <li><span>Just on the left side it feels weird. It’s not really a headache</span></li>

                                <li><span>The headaches were in the back of my head and over my eyes. I would go to sleep and wake up with a headache. I feel as though my head is moving when they are really bad and are whooshing as though I have just taken a long run but have just been sitting down.

The final 2 weeks before surgery I took 5/500 vicodine -- I just slept</span></li>
                                <li><span>I felt like a part of my brain was being squeezed - that happened three times.</span></li>

                                <li><span>I have had head aches in the back of my head most all my life. They are very painful and the only relier I get is lying down and covering my eyes from light.</span></li>
                                <li><span>Worse later in the day. Worse if you would bend over and then stand up.</span></li>

                                <li><span>I woke up with headaches (in the back of my head) every day for months. They kept getting worse, eventually with nausea. By the time I was diagnosed they were very painful, and accompanied by vomiting.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I have headaches for 2 years or more that were migraines but it was the body pain that came about in the last few months and the seizure that I had that made them look at my brain cat scan and MRI then they found the tumor</span></li>
                                <li><span>I don’t have any headache before diagnosis, but after the 2 and half month when Dr. declared that I am ok with my tumor after that time I feel headache around the head may be it’s from cold and sinus</span></li>
                                <li><span>Not extremely painful, usually early morning, around forehead and temple area ..pressure headache</span></li>
                                <li><span>Mine were in the morning when I first woke up and were gone by midmorning. I had them for several years and thought it was caffeine related, since they were fairly mild.</span></li>

All symptoms are now present more often than not. Head pain never leaves, diagnosis-extremely large sub arachniod cyst in posterior fossa, told that it cannot affect me nor cause the symptoms i described,i also have lost some of my intellegnce? i cannot speak nor spel as well as i did and it has also wosrened. No doctor i have seen can tell me what is happening to me, i am always tiold that nothing is related but i have yet to find a docter that can tell me what is happening to me, or why it is happening. They only want to treat the symptoms , i have had headahces since childhood,they became migraines I was told in my late teens, they progressively have grown wosre over time and since the later 90s i developed the siezures and all the rest, I wish i could find a doctor that could explain to me what is happening to my brain and my body. I had to see ten different doctors before i could get a mri and i have seen others since that cannot tell me anything other than the cyst cannot be removed becase of size and location ,the one that gets me is that i am told my heeadache and other symptoms cannoat be explain BUT i am told that nothing can be related back to the golf ball size growth in my head.</span></li>
                                <li><span>I have always had headaches most of my life they seem to be across the top of my eyes and I also suffer from perhaps 1 0r 2 migraines per year. I often used to wake up with a headache</span></li>
                                <li><span>I use to have migraines and would go to sleep but now they go away when they are ready it don’t matter what I take or how much even if I go to sleep</span></li>
                                <li><span>I had headaches since I was a teenager, young adult. In my 20s and 30s, I experienced feelings of deja vu. I wasn’t dx with my tumor until I was 42, and I was told those long-ago feelings of deja vu were most likely seizures. The headaches were increasing and rarely-ending...a severe pounding on the left side of my head to the point every step I took increased the pain. My dx is also debatable. Pathology reports showed a DNET. I had my tumor sent to Johns Hopkins, and they indicated it was a glioma but they could see why my hospital thought it was a DNET.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Can’t recall them enough but do remember that I went from virtually no headaches a year to getting several in the two years before diagnosis and becoming desperate for a painkiller in the last few months, through to those having little effect on the pain. Hmm, vaguely remember spikes going through my head-- nasty with an icy edge, a feeling like a rusty object has. Very similar to some of the ones I currently have, only these ‘new’ ones are worse-- much more pressurized. I have to add that my normal doctor missed the diagnosis after a sudden numb leg and loss of cohesive cognition on a hot day-- he believed it was stroke related. Instead, a year or so later, slurred speech and thoughts, trouble finding words, left side face/arm/leg numbness in an emergency situation caused a doc to order a CT scan, looking for stroke or multiple sclerosis or hypothyroidism instead.</span></li>

                                <li><span>Dear Ann Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with you and Randy as you both look forward to the next steps in your journey to defeat this illness. We pray that you stay strong and not become discouraged. Having experienced this personally as my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor my sophomore year in college when I was twenty, I can empathize with all of you and what you are going through. The ups and downs of treatment, decisions to be made, and just the day to day stuff that still has to be done, can all seem very overwhelming at times. But we do have God to lean on, and you and your family have lived out your faith in Him every day. Your attitude has given hope to so many others that are dealing with similar circumstances, and it is so heartwarming to read their messages to you. I ditto the blogger Fred, who referenced an article that was in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette just this week about a Carnegie Mellon professor who has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I hope you can look it up at post-gazette.com. God’s blessings to all of you.</span></li>
